## Sensorless Homing

If you are running the Einsy board, congrats, you are now done.

For the BTT SKR Mini E3, some further tuning likely needs to happen. Refer to [this guide](https://gist.github.com/clee/9108f7717defce8b1222698f816def0a#finding-the-right-stallguard-threshold) by clee
on setting the correct stallguard threshold.
